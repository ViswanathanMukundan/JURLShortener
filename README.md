An attempt at efficient URL shortening using core Java (and some external dependencies).<br><br>

The original value is mapped to a random shortened URL and this mapping is stored in a MySQL database, the JDBC parameters for which have been implemented using Apache Commons' DBCP Connection pool.<br>
The length of the shortened URL can be dynamically set by the user in the main class.<br><br>

Currently under improvement.
