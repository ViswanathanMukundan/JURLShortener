An attempt at efficient URL shortening using core Java.<br>
The original value is mapped to a random shortened URL and this mapping is stored in a HashMap which is present in a singleton class, for security purposes and simplified code.<br>
The length of the shortened URL can be dynamically set by the user in the main class.<br><br>
Currently under improvement.
